            <h2>Parts of the Mbot Kit</h2>
            <ul>
                    <li>Chassis(Frame) and Wheels:</li>
                    The main body of the robot where all other components are attached.
                    Wheels that allow the robot to move.
                    <li>Motors:</li>
                    Two DC motors that control the movement of the wheels.
                    <li>Control Board:</li>
                    The brain of the mBot, where the code is uploaded and executed.
                    <li>Sensors:</li>
                    Ultrasonic Sensor: Used for distance measurement and obstacle detection.

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The M Bot operates through a combination of sensors, actuators, and programmable logic. Here is a simplified flow of how the M Bot functions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sensors detect the environment (e.g., obstacles, lines).</li>
                <li>Data from the sensors is processed by the M Bot's microcontroller.</li>
                <li>Based on the programmed instructions, the M Bot decides how to respond.</li>
                <li>Actuators (motors, LEDs) carry out the response (e.g., move forward, turn, light up).</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="what-is-scratch">
            <h2>What is Scratch?</h2>
            <p>Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations. It is designed especially for ages 8 to 16, but is used by people of all ages. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.</p>
            <p>Here are some key features of Scratch:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block-based programming: Scratch uses a visual programming language where you drag and drop code blocks to create programs.</li>
                <li>Easy to use: It provides an intuitive interface that is easy for beginners to learn and use.</li>
                <li>Interactive projects: You can create games, animations, and interactive stories that respond to user input.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information, you can visit the official <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch website</a>.</p>
